# Introduction
- One of the important features for any software is its size which is also a crucial estimate for the defect proneness of the software
- An interesting theory of relative defect proneness (RDP)  states that in large-scale software systems, smaller modules will be proportionally more defect-prone compared to larger modules
- Our project aims at studying the research results for ‘Defect Density Estimation’
- As part of this study, we would be replicating the results of [‘Theory of relative defect proneness’](http://link.springer.com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/article/10.1007%2Fs10664-008-9080-x) for a software using available data sets to test the RDP theory
- A major part of this is investigating the functional form of the size-defect relationship for software modules
- With the results we can show that preferring the smallest-first strategy as opposed to the largest-first can lead to greater cost effectiveness and adhere to good quality assurance practices
